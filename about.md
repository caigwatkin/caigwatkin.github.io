# About me

The range of experiences I've had, both professionally and personally, have given me a very solid foundation from which to launch into any new challenge in the broader industries of software, technology, innovation, and business.
My idea of a successful organisation is people over processes, culture over structure, enabling over requiring.
I am inspired by change, motivated by helping people, and interested in doing good.

I believe the story of my six years at LocalCover/Boxer will reveal a lot about my fit within an organisation:

The idea was to carve out a new space in online shopping by servicing post-purchase issue resolution needs of cross-border online shoppers.
The challenge was to support scaling up in sales and out in market segments.
We built a robust foundation in our scalable platform: providing and enabling integrations for sales to customers via established online retailers; leveraging ML and AI for dynamic, scalable quoting; customer engagements and apps to provide value to those online shoppers; a suite of tools enabling staff in their issue resolution processes; a growing knowledge base that enabled automation; an array of internal apps supporting other business processes; and data analytics for evidence-guided business practices.
Over the six years I was involved, I was hands on with almost every aspect of our technical solutioning and implementations, supported by a range of inspiring mentors.

I started as a software engineer in our initially flat engineering structure, focusing on developing our backend microservices, integrated with cloud platforms and leveraged by our suite of apps.
I was the eighth employee at LocalCover, motivated to create simple and lasting solutions to complex problems, inspired by the hope that what I make will be used to help people; even after six years here, I am still very motivated by these things.
From the beginning, I was interested in being involved in the bigger picture of engineering at the company and I was supported in efforts to improve the ways we worked alongside my role in building up our technical capabilities.
As the company grew, I moved into full stack software engineering, seeing that our service framework had matured and that the needs became complex such that end-to-end involvement could better realise a valuable and cohesive solution.

Bringing the collaborative approach to engineering excellence from our backend development to the full stack was a rewarding endeavour.
Peer reviewed code allowed us to transfer knowledge, offer help, and stay connected.
The move to bring a comprehensive yet nuanced testing frameworks and approaches to the full stack enabled more reliability as we enhanced, refactored, or replaced core features in the live production environment.
Our sophisticated devops pipeline enabled engineers to focus more on solving business problems, aided by the architectural decisions of the codebase at large.
Important decisions and approaches being decided within the relatively large engineering team in inclusive debates empowered our thoughtful people to enable their own successes.

Throughout my time here, juggling the evolving and often urgent business priorities was exciting, seeing our engineered solutions progress from good-enough to highly-flexible was encouraging.
My interest in always gaining more knowledge of the business domain proved extremely valuable when starting new projects and understanding user needs.
My efforts in building and extending the features of our tech stack with all the important tenets of extensibility, reliability, and scalability in mind meant we were able to evolve solutions over replacing them.
The building of solid working relationships, encouraging diversity, promoting inclusivity, and supporting psychological safety within my team and the wider organisation gained in importance to me over my time, as I understood how valuable each individual is in such an environment.
The move to being a team lead was a natural progression from my day-to-day, encouraged by my mentors.
My efforts to become a force-multiplier went from being an organic emergence within the engineering department to part of my role recognized by the business - I went from being the person engineers came to for help, to working on enabling the engineers to help themselves.

My commitment to seeing through the intention of the business is something I am proud of.
I feel that my continual commitment to the pursuit of the shared vision was valuable, sticking with the people through all of the ups and downs was important.

My time in the industry has taught me a lot about myself and I hope to be an authentic part of an organisation doing amazing things with good people.
