# Cai Gwatkin

As a full-stack software engineer, I thrive on bridging the gap between dreams and deployment.
Backed by years of experience crafting cloud-based products with global reach, I bring a diverse skill set and a passion for building impactful solutions.
For me, it is about more than just writing code; I seek to build relationships, foster innovation, and ultimately turn aspirations into tangible realities.

Technical expertise: Iâ€™m adept in navigating the full software development lifecycle, from conception to deployment and beyond.

Collaborative spirit: I believe in the power of connection and teamwork, fostering creativity and open communication in every project.

Adaptability and growth: I embrace a continuous learning mindset, readily optimising workflows and tackling high-change environments with a solutions-oriented approach.

## Industry experience

### Lead Software Engineer

Boxer Group Services Limited - 2017 to 2023.

My time as a software engineer at Boxer began with creating our core features which were serving our first production customers within 8 months.
I gained a range and depth of experience in all aspects of the development lifecycle and business domains thanks to our modern engineering culture and dedication to engineering excellence.
From early in 2022, I led a team of engineers during our ambitious rebranded launch of Boxer (originally called LocalCover).
I'm proud of the impact I had on our growth, both in the expansion of business capabilities and in the culture of the organisation.
