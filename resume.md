## Boxer/LocalCover

From December 2017 through October 2023, I worked as an engineer at the Boxer company (initially branded as LocalCover).
We built, enhanced, and maintained a suite of bespoke apps and services to facilitate business operations which involved selling issue resolution services for online shoppers, enabling local solutions for global, cross-border purchases.
I was heavily involved in development related to most domains within our business, including: sales, marketing, operations, accounting, security, solution architecture, and devops.

Some accomplishments I'm proud of:

- Creating and evolving the framework used for all of our Golang microservices.
- Solutioning and development of our identity and access management service which all requests to our microservices utilised.
- Creating and evolving the features and functionality of our issue resolution tooling which was the core of business operations.

Proficiencies (transferable):

- Various languages: Golang, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, bash, Python, Java, YAML, etc.
- Various frameworks/standards: React, TypeScript, Web Components, REST/RPC/OpenAPI, TDD, CI/CD, OAuth, etc.
- Various cloud products: GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud Tasks, Pub/Sub, Cloud KMS, etc.), Twilio, SendGrid, etc.
