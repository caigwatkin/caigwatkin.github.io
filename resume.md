## Industry experience: Boxer/LocalCover

From December 2017 until October 2023, Cai worked as a software engineer at the company Boxer (initially branded as LocalCover).
The company positioned itself as selling issue resolution services for online shoppers to use local solutions for problems such as product faults on their cross-border purchases.

Cai was heavily involved in software engineering from very early on, being one of the first ten employees, and with most domains within the business, including: sales, marketing, operations, accounting, and engineering.

This was a complex domain in which potentially thousands of online retailers in any country could be selling millions of unique products into any other country, for which the shopper's issue raised with Boxer might need a similarly unique solution.
Many of the software solutions focused on connecting the shopper with organisations in their local area that could solve their issue.
This involves issue identification, options for solutions, engaging with the local organisation, logistics, and a great deal of communication.
